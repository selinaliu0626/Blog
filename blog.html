        <h2 class="ui center aligned header">Some Ideas to Improve Google map </h2>
        <div id="content" class="m-padded-tb-large">
            <p>Many people complained about Google map,after did some research and combined with my
                own experience, I had some ideas to add some new features on it.</p>
            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <p>
                (1)	Confused when drive to the fork in the road.
                (2)	Can’t stop and change destination in the highway
                (3)	Miss the right exit
                (4)	Get the wrong information from google map, such as parking info
                (5)	Wrong position showed in the map, the data latency?
                (6)	Can’t distinguish other languages for the user

            </p>
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>
                (1)	Customer could choose the right path at the fork in the road
                (2)	Customers can use service without touch
                (3)	Customer could get in time reminder for exit in highway
                (4)	Exact information providers, such as parking
                (5)	Increase the accuracy for navigation
                (6)	Some other service, weather reminder, language services, etc.
            </p>
            <h5>To reach these goals, I think we could </h5>
            <p>
                (1)	show pictures with arrows to help customer find the right way at the fork
                (2)	set a voice assistant, to help people get the service without touch
                (3)	voice assistant will reminder you with every exit in highway
                (4)	Collect more information and audit to make sure the information provide to customers are correct, also customers could report wrong info to the development team.
                (5)	Use multiple way to locate car, WIFI, GPS, radio, etc., and navigation, in case one of them are useless or not correct right now.
                (6)	More preference setting available, for the add on service.

            </p>
            <h5>Key customer segments:</h5>
            <p>
                (1)	Self-driving travelers: people who self-driving and travel a lot must use navigation app to help find the way
                (2)	People with poor sense of direction: people with poor sense of direction may could not drive without navigation app.

            </p>
            <h4>Scenarios</h4>
            <h5 class="ui center aligned header">Self -driving to Children’s Museum</h5>
            <p>
                    Mark saw some good activities has been post in Boston children`s museum, since his home is only 30 minutes’ driving to Boston children’s museum,
                he takes his kids to take part in these activities. Even he drives a lot, but the roads in Boston still confuse him. So, he opens the google map, and follow the reminds of it.
            </p>
            <p>He is very satisfied with the journey first, he forgets refill the gas, google map can easily find nearest gas station for him,
                but during his way to Boston, his kids want to eat DQ, he wants to find his closest DQ in highway, but unfortunately he cannot change destination,
                unless he stops, and choose it by hand,  that is too dangerous when you do this way, so he could only persuade his kids to wait him out of the highway,
                then he could choose a certain store. The younger son cried about it, but that is the safest choice he can make.
            </p>
            <p>When he is close to children`s museum, he finds the suggest way is on construction, there is some staff hold a sign and tell them to go another way,
                he is first arrived there, so he is upset to the result, and hope the road will not be too far to go back. Luckily it is not that far, when he finally arrived at the museum,
                the staff told him that will be 25 to parking. He is so surprised that parking is so expensive, so he checks for google map, it does have a suggestion for parking, he drive ahead to there,
                but the sign says south end residence only. He is so disappointing about the wrong information. When he finally finds the parking lot, it begins to rain heavily,
                he is ok with the rain, but he worried his kids will get cold without umbrella.
            </p>
            <p>< magic happens ></p>
            <p>When open the Google map, it will remind the weather today, Mark gets the news that it will snow in afternoon, so he takes snow coat for kids. And it could change destination by communicate with app, no worried for stop in the highway.
                Also, it will show parking zones near your destination, and has specific information about each zone correctly. </p>
            <h5 class="ui center aligned header">Drive to the outlet</h5>
            <p>
                Anna lives in north gate, she has a short-long weekend for their well-being day on Friday, she thinks it is a great opportunity to shopping in the outlets, because there are almost too many people show there in weekends.
                After some simple dress up, she drives to Outlets which is about 40 minutes away from her home
            </p>
            <p>
                She starts the car, even she has been there for couple times, but she still confused how to drive there.
                When she lunch the app, she wants to input the correct name for the destination , but somehow,
                she forget the English for outlet, because she also always call it”奥莱“ instead, so she need to use translator to translate first, then she can find the right place. When she uses google map to navigation,
                it been quite easy for the way from her home to 5 road, because google map has reminds for every turn.
                But when she drives in 5 road, google map shows there is some traffic jam in the next section and suggest her to drive out the 5 road and choose the normal road to avoid traffic jam. She is a little doubt about this,
                but she chooses to trust google map and exit the 5 road, but she still can see the situation on 5 road,
                she is certainly true that there is no traffic jam on it. And she has no need to exit and drive to the small road which has more traffic lights and more complex situations.
                So, she chooses to select the road which let her go back to 5 road. During her way to outlets, there is no voice reminder for the fork in the road or the exit,
                she needs to check the screen for the clear information and try to recognize the exact number for her exit, it always makes her direction crooked a little,
                even one time, she was out of her lane and too closed to other people`s car. When she is very closed to outlets, google map tell her the destination is on her left side,
                but she is on the right side of the road, and there is two solid yellow line in the middle of the road, that means she cannot just turn right to the outlet,
                she needs to find somewhere allow her to turn U-turn, but google map does not show the right route. She does not want to stop and choose the route,
                so she just keeps go forward and let google map know her is still trying to find her way, after 1 minutes’ drive,
                when outlet is obvious not on her right side, google map give the right way to outlet.
            </p>
            <p> < magic happens > </p>
            <p>
                Google map know what means ”奥莱”， and provide the correct info for traffic jam, and always point to the most effective way for people, Emily receives each voice reminder for each crossroad or fork in the road, and it also reminder you when you need to exit in next section. When she is on the opposite direction of the destination, google map will choose somewhere to make U-turn or make left turn to other entry.

            </p>
